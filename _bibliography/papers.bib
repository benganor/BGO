  title={Cortical circuits modulate mouse social vocalizations},
  author={*Gan-Or, B.* and London, M.},
  abstract={Vocalizations provide a means of communication with high fidelity and information rate for many species. Male mice emit ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) during female courtship. Diencephalon and brainstem neural circuits have been shown to control the production of USVs, however, the role of cortical circuits in this process is debatable. We show that male mice produced USVs following intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) in a specific location of their anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Moreover, ACC Ca2+-imaging showed an increase in Ca2+ dynamics preceding USV initiation. Optogenetically suppressing ACC activity caused mice to emit fewer USVs during courtship. Neuropixel electrophysiological recordings in head-restrained male mice indicated a differential increase in neural activity in response to female social exposure (SE). The firing rate in SE trials where USVs were emitted was significantly higher when compared to SE leading to silence. Taken together, these results indicate that the ACC is a key node in the neuronal circuits controlling USV production.},

  title={Temporal structure of mouse courtship vocalizations facilitates syllable labeling.},
  author={Hertz, S., *Weiner, B.*, Peretz, N. and London, M.},
  abstract={Mice emit sequences of ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) but little is known about the rules governing their temporal order and no consensus exists on the classification of USVs into syllables. To address these questions, we recorded USVs during male-female courtship and found a significant temporal structure. We labeled USVs using three popular algorithms and found that there was no one-to-one relationships between their labels. As label assignment affects the high order temporal structure, we developed the Syntax Information Score (based on information theory) to rank labeling algorithms based on how well they predict the next syllable in a sequence. Finally, we derived a novel algorithm (Syntax Information Maximization) that utilizes sequence statistics to improve the clustering of individual USVs with respect to the underlying sequence structure. Improvement in USV classification is crucial for understanding neural control of vocalization. We demonstrate that USV syntax holds valuable information towards achieving this goal.},

  title={Adrenergic Modulation Regulates the Dendritic Excitability of Layer 5 Pyramidal Neurons In Vivo},
  author={Labarrera C, Deitcher Y, Dudai A, *Weiner B*, Kaduri Amichai A, Zylbermann N, and London M.},
  abstract={The excitability of the apical tuft of layer 5 pyramidal neurons is thought to play a crucial role in behavioral performance and synaptic plasticity. We show that the excitability of the apical tuft is sensitive to adrenergic neuromodulation. Using two-photon dendritic Ca2+ imaging and in vivo whole-cell and extracellular recordings in awake mice, we show that application of the α2A-adrenoceptor agonist guanfacine increases the probability of dendritic Ca2+ events in the tuft and lowers the threshold for dendritic Ca2+ spikes. We further show that these effects are likely to be mediated by the dendritic current Ih. Modulation of Ih in a realistic compartmental model controlled both the generation and magnitude of dendritic calcium spikes in the apical tuft. These findings suggest that adrenergic neuromodulation may affect cognitive processes such as sensory integration, attention, and working memory by regulating the sensitivity of layer 5 pyramidal neurons to top-down inputs.},
