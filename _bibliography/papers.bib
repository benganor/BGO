  title={Cortical circuits modulate mouse social vocalizations},
  author={Gan-Or, B. and London, M.},
  abstract={Vocalizations provide a means of communication with high fidelity and information rate for many species. Male mice emit ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) during female courtship. Diencephalon and brainstem neural circuits have been shown to control the production of USVs, however, the role of cortical circuits in this process is debatable. We show that male mice produced USVs following intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) in a specific location of their anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Moreover, ACC Ca2+-imaging showed an increase in Ca2+ dynamics preceding USV initiation. Optogenetically suppressing ACC activity caused mice to emit fewer USVs during courtship. Neuropixel electrophysiological recordings in head-restrained male mice indicated a differential increase in neural activity in response to female social exposure (SE). The firing rate in SE trials where USVs were emitted was significantly higher when compared to SE leading to silence. Taken together, these results indicate that the ACC is a key node in the neuronal circuits controlling USV production.},

  title={Temporal structure of mouse courtship vocalizations facilitates syllable labeling.},
  author={Hertz, S., Weiner, B., Peretz, N. and London, M.},
  abstract={Mice emit sequences of ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) but little is known about the rules governing their temporal order and no consensus exists on the classification of USVs into syllables. To address these questions, we recorded USVs during male-female courtship and found a significant temporal structure. We labeled USVs using three popular algorithms and found that there was no one-to-one relationships between their labels. As label assignment affects the high order temporal structure, we developed the Syntax Information Score (based on information theory) to rank labeling algorithms based on how well they predict the next syllable in a sequence. Finally, we derived a novel algorithm (Syntax Information Maximization) that utilizes sequence statistics to improve the clustering of individual USVs with respect to the underlying sequence structure. Improvement in USV classification is crucial for understanding neural control of vocalization. We demonstrate that USV syntax holds valuable information towards achieving this goal.},
