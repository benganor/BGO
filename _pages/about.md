I am deeply curious about the **brain**. How does an ensemble of action potentials relate to our rich experience of the world?
I have explored auditory plasticity in healthy and diseased brains and 
examined cortical control over courtship-related ultrasonic vocalizations.

I am searching for a company where I can use next-generation technology to further our understanding of the brain and solve real-world problems.
